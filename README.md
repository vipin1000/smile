# Smile Detection Using CNN from Scratch üòÅ

## Overview üßê

This project demonstrates how to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch and use it to detect smiles in images. The model is trained to classify whether a person is smiling or not based on their facial expression. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image recognition tasks, making them an ideal choice for this project.

In this project, we will:
- Build and train a CNN model using Keras/TensorFlow.
- Use a dataset of facial images to detect the presence of a smile.
- Evaluate the model's accuracy and performance in detecting smiles.

## Features üöÄ

**Custom CNN Architecture**: Build a Convolutional Neural Network with multiple convolutional layers.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Apply transformations to images (resizing, normalization) to improve model performance.
- **Smile Detection**: The model classifies images into two categories: smiling and not smiling.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the CNN with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
